# surfs_up

## Purpose

For this exercise, we have decided to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii and are looking to get capital from a few outside investors. Opening a retail business can be risky, so in order to calm the investors fears, we decided to dig a little deeper in the weather data we had collected in order to prove our start up can operate year-round. This would show that the store is sustainable and overall less of a risk. In order to show this, we focused on the months of June and December to see how the weather differ between seasons.  

## Results

Below are the temperature data for June and December.
