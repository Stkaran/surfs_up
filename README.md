# surfs_up

## Purpose

For this exercise, we have decided to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii and are looking to get capital from a few outside investors. Opening a retail business can be risky, so in order to calm the investors fears, we decided to dig a little deeper in the weather data we had collected in order to prove our start up can operate year-round. This would show that the store is sustainable and overall less of a risk. In order to show this, we focused on the months of June and December to see how the weather differ between seasons.  

## Results

Below are the temperature data for June and December.

As we can see from the data there are three major diffences between the two months.
    
   * First, the mean temperature and three degrees higher in June compared to December.
   * Second, the lowest minimum temperature is eight degrees lower in December when compared to June.
   * And lastly, the higher standard deviation figure in December shows the month's temperatures have a 
     higher degree of varibility than June's.

## Summary

Although there are a few differences between the two months, June and December are close enough in temperature that either could be considered viable for surfing and ice cream weather. If we wanted to go deeper, the next logical step would be to compare the amount of percipitation between the two. If there is increased rainfall, chances if urban runoff contaminating the seawater is higher, so surfers way stay away if it is raining a lot. 

Looking further down the line, if this store is a success, there may be interest in opening other locations on the surrounding islands. Our data would help here as we have data for a total of nine different weather stations. All we would need to do is pull that locations data and compare it to the data that we've gathered here.
