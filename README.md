# surfs_up

## Purpose

For this exercise, we have decided to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii and are looking to get capital from a few outside investors. Opening a retail business can be risky, so in order to calm the investors fears, we decided to dig a little deeper in the weather data we had collected in order to prove our start up can operate year-round. This would show that the store is sustainable and overall less of a risk. In order to show this, we focused on the months of June and December to see how the weather differ between seasons.  

## Results

Below are the temperature data for June and December.

As we can see from the data there are three major diffences between the two months.
    
   * First, the mean temperature and three degrees higher in June compared to December.
   * Second, the lowest minimum temperature is eight degrees lower in December when compared to June.
   * And lastly, the higher standard deviation figure in December shows the month's temperatures have a 
     higher degree of varibility than June's.
